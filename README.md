# Nova-Stat

Nova-Stat is a project I randomly decided to create today.

Nova-Stat is a program designed to display statistic information about a player of the Roblox game \[:\] Glacier Rebirth.

## Features

- Per-Department Ranks
- Clearance Level

I may add more features in future.

## Extra Information

Nova-Stat is compiled into an executable from the Python sourcecode using [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/), a tool which transpiles the Python source code into C, and then compiles the C into the end result, a `.exe` file.
This method of compilation keeps the Nova-Stat quite lightweight, and doesn't require that the entire program be unpacked, along with its dependencies, into your temp folder.

Currently, binaries are only provided for Windows, this is unlikely to change in the future due to me not knowing how to compile the Python code into a Linux executable, but potentially could change.
Mac executables will never be provided.
